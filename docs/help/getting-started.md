## Install a Wallet

If a wallet is already installed and configured you can skip this step, otherwise install one of the supported wallets...

- [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap) (Chrome & Brave)

Support for these wallets is coming soon...

- [Starshell](https://starshell.net/)
- [Citadel.One](https://citadel.one/)

## Connect your Wallet

Before you can use dApps on Secret Network your wallet needs to be connected to the Secret Network blockchain. This only needs to be done once, so you may already be connected if you have used another Secret Network dApp.

1. Visit [Stashh](https://stashh.io) or click the **Wallet** button in the top left.
2. If your wallet is not already connected it will ask to connect to `secret-4`. Click **Approve**

        Always make sure you are connecting to the **Secret-4** network and **stashh.io**

## Authenticate your Wallet

You can browse Stashh without authenticating, but you must be authenticated to buy, sell, create, manage or or view sNFTs

Authenticating is like logging into an account but without the need for a username or password. Your wallet acts as your login credentials.

If you are not authenticated the Account Menu icon :duotone-user: will be grey, and when you click it there will be an **Authenticate** button in the menu.

1. Click the Account Menu :duotone-user: then click the **Authenticate** button.

2. Check the message that pops up then click **Authenticate Wallet**
3. Your wallet will ask you to create a Permit. Click **Approve**

    === "Keplr"

4. A success message will pop up, and the Account Menu icon :duotone-user: will light up to show you're authenticated.

## Optional Steps

### Create a sSCRT Permit

The majority of transactions on Stashh are denominated in sSCRT which is a privacy preserving version of SCRT. Because it is privacy preserving you need to grant Stashh permission to view your sSCRT balance with a Viewing Key.

1. Click the Account Menu icon :duotone-user:

    ![Account menu showing the View sSCRT Balance button](/images/account-menu-show-balance.png#pop)

2. Click **View sSCRT Balance**
3. If you have not already added sSCRT to your wallet it will pop up a message asking you to add a new token. Click **Submit**

    === "Keplr"

4. Your wallet will ask you if you would like to create a Viewing Key for sSCRT. Click **Approve**
5. After a few moments your sSCRT balance will appear in the menu where *View sSCRT Balance* was. It will probably be 0 for now.

### Explore Stashh

Now that you're authenticated you can use all the features Stashh has to offer.

Check out the [Marketplace](https://stashh.io/marketplace?sort=listing_date+desc&status=buy_now%2Cauction) by clicking the **Marketplace** link on the menu bar to see what is for sale. Explore the filters on the left, and adjust the way sNFTs are sorted using the dropdown menu in the top right.
