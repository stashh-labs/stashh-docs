# Hard Reload an NFT

To improve performance Stashh keeps local copies of some of the public data about your NFT. Sometimes this information can fall out of sync with the blockchain and this can result in strange behaviour including....

- incorrect sales history
- NFTs  appearing not to be on sale when they are
- listings failing
- incorrect ownership information

If something doesn't look right with your NFT you can re-sync it with the network. This will not create a transaction, and is totally free.

1. Go to the NFT that looks incorrect.
2. Click the Hard Reload icon :fontawesome-solid-arrow-rotate-right: in the top right corner of the page.
3. Wait a few seconds for Stashh to fetch data from the network.

!!! note

    if it doesn't work first time wait a couple of minutes and try again.
