# Clear Local Application Data

When you authenticate or create a Permit Stashh stores information about the Permit in your browser so that you don't have to request the same Permits over and over every time you do something on Stashh.

If you are having issues with authentication or permits you can manually clear out this data.

!!! warning
    This will sign you out of Stashh and remove all the permits you have created. You will need to re-authenticate with Stashh and create permits for each collection you own.

1. Press **F12**
2. Click the **Application Tab**
3. Click the **Local Storage** tab on the left to expand it.
4. Right click **https://stashh.io**
5. Click **Clear**
6. Reload the page

If you need to sign back into your Stashh account follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](../collector/getting-started.md) guide
