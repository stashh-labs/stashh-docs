# Hard Reload a sNFT

To improve performance Stashh keeps local copies of some of the public data about your sNFT. Sometimes this information can fall out of sync with the blockchain and this can result in strange behaviour including....

- incorrect sales history
- sNFTs  appearing not to be on sale when they are
- listings failing
- incorrect ownership information

If something doesn't look right with your sNFT you can re-sync it with the network. This will not create a transaction, and is totally free.

1. Go to the sNFT with the problem.
2. Click the Menu icon :fontawesome-solid-ellipsis-vertical: in the top right.
3. Click Refresh Asset
4. Wait a few seconds for Stashh to fetch data from the network.

!!! note

    if it doesn't work first time, or you get an error message wait a couple of minutes and try again.
