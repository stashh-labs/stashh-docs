# Stashh Testnet

The Stashh Testnet is an identical version of Stashh running on the `Pulsar-2` blockchain, which itself is a functional copy of the `Secret-4` blockchain, but with much higher validator rewards. `Pulsar-2` is used for testing dApps and Smart Contracts before releasing them onto `Secret-4` where they interact with real assets.

Because `Pulsar-2` is only used for testing all the asserts on it (including SCRT and SNIP20 tokens) are worthless so there is no real risk when experimenting.
