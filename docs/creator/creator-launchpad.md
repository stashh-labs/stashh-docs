# Stashh Creator Launchpad

New creators need to be checked and approved before they can create or import collections on Stashh. This is a temporary restriction, and eventually we will open minting to everyone using a system of automated checks and on-chain reputation signifiers.

It's free to join the Creator Launchpad.

To apply for the program please fill out the form at [apply.stashh.io](https://apply.stashh.io). 

## Required Information

You will need these details to submit an application...

- An email address where you can receive our response
- The Secret Network address of the wallet that will own the collection
- Social media addresses for your collection
- A sample of the media from your collection
- Links to your collection if it is already published on another blockchain

## Process

Once you have submitted your application we conduct some checks to detect scams and copies. Once this has been completed we send you a response containing our decision and any next steps. Usually this happens quite quickly but it can take up to 7 days if we are really busy. In some cases we may need to ask for additional information, or ask you to perform some additional verification steps.

Whatever our decision is you will _always_ receive a response from us by email. If you have not received a response after 7 days please check your Spam folder then contact us at [collections@stashh.io](mailto:collections.stashh.io)

## Success

If your application is successful you will receive immediate access to the Creator tools on Stashh, so you can create and launch your collection as soon as you get the approval email.

If you submitted a Discord username with your application we will give it the Creator role on the [Stashh Discord server](https://chat.stashh.io) which lets you access private creators-only channels.

## Rejection

If your application is unsuccessful you will receive an email explaining why. You can appeal the rejection by responding to the rejection email with an explanation of why you believe our conclusion is incorrect.

The top reasons why collections get rejected are...

- They use artwork that the creator doesn't own.
- They use assets that the creator doesn't have the right to use commercially.
- They would be classed as a security in the United States.
- They could be classified as a lottery, or fall under regulated gambling laws in the US.

We will also reject collections that...

- Encourage violence or hate directed at a particular group or person.
- Contain content that is illegal in the United States.
