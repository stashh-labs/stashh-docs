Hello creators! Using our minting tool, anyone can create their own Secret NFTs or Secret Badges on Stashh. This page will walk you through the workflow so that you can create your own assets on Stashh right away.

## Create a new collection

Head to the Stashh [homepage](https://stashh.io/) and click the **Create** button near the top right corner of the page.

![Create](/images/Permissionless Minting_Create.png#pop)

On the **Create Your Secret NFTs** screen, choose whether you would like to **Create a New Collection**, **Import a Collection**, or **Select an Existing Collection**. For this example, letâ€™s Create a New Collection.

![Create Youre Secret NFTs](/images/Permissionless Minting_Create New Collection.png#pop)

On the **Create a New Collection** screen, add your **logo** and **banner image**. The recommended size of the logo is 300 x 300 (max 1MB), and of the banner is 1360 x 200 (max 3MB).

![Add Logo and Banner Image](/images/Permissionless Minting_Collection Images.png#pop)

Next, add an awesome **Collection Name** and **Description**, and set the most accurate **Categories**. You can select more than one category.

Finally, review and modify the settings to make sure that your collection operates as you expect. Each can be toggled ON or OFF depending on your use case.

- Enable Royalties
      - Every NFT created within this collection can have the royalties apply you set here by default. You can add up to five wallets and set a percentage for each one.
- Private Ownership
    - The owners of this collection will be kept private from the public. No one would be able to see who owns the asset.
- Enable Burn Asset Feature
      - Choose whether or not the owners can burn their NFT.
- Hide Collection until I decide to Reveal it
    - Your collection will be hidden from the public until you are ready to reveal it. 
    - When you are ready to reveal, go to the **Created Collection** section in your My Stashh page, select the collection, and click the **Reveal** button.
- Allow me to Update Assets after they are created/minted
    - This is to enable Dynamic Content, and must be enabled on this page during the collection creation process. It cannot be enabled later once the collection has been created.

![Collection Settings](/images/Permissionless Minting_Collection Settings.png#pop)

When youâ€™re ready, click **Create Collection**. Your Keplr wallet will appear asking you to approve the gas transaction. Once you approve the transaction, the collection will be created.

The last step is to **Create a Permit**. A permit proves you have access before unlocking hidden data on Stashh. (This is handled by the blockchain itself!)

Once your permit has been created, youâ€™re ready to select your asset format.

## Select your asset format

Stashh provides a few options for you to choose from:

- Regular Asset
    - Create a regular NFT or save as a draft
- Asset with Copies
    - Create an NFT with specific or unlimited number of copies
- Badges
    - Create rewards and giveaways and setup claim codes or sales price (tickets)
- Drafts
    - Create a batch of regular assets at once by uploading a spreadsheet
- Gumball Machine
    - Load it with regular assets, set a price, and allow users to buy one randomly (great for primary drops)

### Regular Asset

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qV-gXnpQ5Yg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this example, weâ€™ll focus on creating a regular NFT, so weâ€™ll click **Regular Asset** to start creating.

Secret NFTs are unique, in that you can create an asset with **hidden properties** that only the owner can see and **public properties** that everyone can see. Weâ€™ll use this page to create one of these assets.

First, weâ€™ll attached our hidden file, then our public thumbnail. The hidden file section can support multiple types of hidden files, such as an image, audio clip, text file, and more.

- Hidden files supported: JPG, PNG, GIF, MP3, MP4, and GLB
- Thumbnail files supported: JPG, PNG, GIF, MP3, MP4, and GLB

Any files uploaded to the Hidden Files or Thumbnail File section are uploaded to IPFS.

Next, add any private or public links. **Any links are not uploaded to IPFS. You are responsible for keeping up with these links.**

![Asset Links](/images/Permissionless Minting_Hidden File Links.png#pop)

Now, add an awesome **Name** and **Description** to your asset.

![Asset Name and Description](/images/Permissionless Minting_Asset Name.png#pop)

In the next section, add your **Properties**, which can be public, protected, or private.

- Public
    - Anyone can see the name and value
- Protected
    - Anyone can see the name, but only the owner can see the value
- Private
    - Only the owner can see the name and value

Click the **Add Property** button to add a new property.

![Asset Properties](/images/Permissionless Minting_Asset Properties.png#pop)

In our final steps, confirm your royalty settings in the **Enable Royalties** section. Whatever you set up on the collection level will be reflected here.

You can toggle royalties ON or OFF on your asset, as well as update wallet addresses or the percentages associated.

![Enable Royalties](/images/Permissionless Minting_Enable Royalties.png#pop)

The last setting is **Place Asset for Sale**, which allows you to create your listing on this page once the toggle is turned ON.

![List Asset for Sale](/images/Permissionless Minting_Place Asset for Sale.png#pop)

Once we have finalized our asset we have two options:

- Save as Draft
    - Work on and mint this asset later
- Create NFT
    - Mint now

## Accessing your drafts

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdWTXAXYHNU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To access your drafts, go to your **My Stashh** page, click the **Created Collections** section, then select the collection that contains your draft.

![Created Collections](/images/Permissionless Minting_Created Collections.png#pop)

Click the **Manage** button near the top right of the page, then click the **Drafts** tab. Youâ€™ll see all of the drafts associated with this collection here.

![Drafts](/images/Permissionless Minting_Drafts.png#pop)

Use this page to perform a few actions to your draft:

- View the draft as it would appear as a minted asset on Stashh by clicking the eye icon
- Edit the draft by clicking the pencil
- Mint the draft

![Draft Actions](/images/Permissionless Minting_Draft Actions.png#pop)

## Mint your asset

Youâ€™ll have two opportunities to mint your asset:

1. While creating your asset following the **Select Asset Format** page
2. On the Drafts page as just mentioned

Before the asset is minted, you will see a Keplr popup that asked you to approve the gas transaction. Stashh will present a confirmation popup once the mint is complete.

*And thatâ€™s it!* You have now created your own NFTs on Stashh. Time to go promote your collection - or discover others. Happy Stashhing!
