## Thumbnails

Thumbnails should be 1:1 (square), but for best results they should be 550px by 550px. 

We recommend keeping the file size as small as possible. Bear in mind that 90% of the time the Thumbnail image will be shown as a 250px square images.

!!! warning

    You can use any of the supported file formats for a Thumbnail but if you use anything other than PNG, JPG, or GIF the Thumbnail will be shown as a content icon in the Marketplace.

## Originals

Original files can be any dimensions or aspect-ratio with a maximum file size of 70mb.
