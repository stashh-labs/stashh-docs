# Import a Collection

!!! warning

    You need to be an approved creator in order to create or import collections on Stashh. For more details about how this works please read the [Creator Launchpad](../creator-launchpad.md) page

!!! warning

    You must be authenticated with the wallet that owns the collection contract to be able to import it

1. Make sure you are authenticated with your whitelisted wallet then click the Account Menu icon :duotone-user: on the navigation bar.
2. Click **Import Collection**.
3. Enter the Secret Network address of your collection in the **Collection Address** field.
4. Click the **Import** button.
5. Wait for Stashh to finish importing the collection.

By default the collection will be hidden from the marketplace. We recommend that you do not disable this, as it will allow you to check that the collection is correct and configure it in Stashh before revealing it.

To complete setting up your collection please follow the instructions in [Edit a Collection](./edit-collection.md), and when you are ready to reveal it follow the instructions in [Reveal a Collection](./reveal-collection.md).
