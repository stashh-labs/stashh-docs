# Stashh Early Access Creator Program

Currently you need to apply and be approved before you can create or import collections on Stashh. This is a temporary restriction, and eventually we will open minting to everyone using a system of automated checks and on-chain reputation.

To apply for the program please fill out the form at [https://apply.stashh.io](https://apply.stashh.io). You will need some details before you can submit an application

- An email address where you can receive our response
- The Secret Network address of the wallet that will own the collection
- Social media addresses for your collection
- A sample of the media from your collection
- Links to your collection if it is already published on another blockchain

A separate application is required for each collection, even if you are using the same whitelisted wallet.

Once you have submitted your application we conduct some background checks to detect scams and copies. Once this has been completed we send you a response containing our decision and any next steps. Usually this happens within 48 hours, but it can take up to 10 days if we are really busy. In some cases we may need to ask for additional information, or ask you to perform some additional verification steps.

Whatever our decision is you will _always_ receive a response from us by email. If you have not received a response after 7 days please check your Spam folder before contacting us.p
