# Fixed Price

A Fixed Price Sale is the simplest type of sale on Stashh. When you list a sNFT for sale using Fixed Price it will be shown for sale in the Marketplace at the price you set until someone buys it or you decide to cancel the sale.

The price of a Fixed Price sale can be changed at any time, and the sale can be cancelled at any time.

When a buyer is found for a Fixed Price listing the exchange happens immediately. The cost of the sNFT is debited from the buyers wallet, fees and royalties are processed, proceeds are sent to the seller, and the sNFT is released from escrow to the buyer.
