# Fixed Price

A Fixed Price Sale is the simplest type of sale on Stashh. When you list a sNFT for sale using Fixed Price it will be shown for sale in the Marketplace at the price you set until someone buys it or you decide to cancel the sale.

Fixed Price sales work within our standard [Fees](./fees.md) and Royalty schedule.
