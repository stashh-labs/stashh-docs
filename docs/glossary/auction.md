# Auction

An auction is a mechanism to find the optimal price for an sNFT. When you list an sNFT for sale as an Auction on Stashh it will be shown in the marketplace for a set period of time during which potential buyers place bids. When the timer expires the sNFT is sold to the highest bidder. You can also set an optional Buy Now price that will cause the auction to end early when reached.
