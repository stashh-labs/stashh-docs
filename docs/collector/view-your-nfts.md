# Viewing your sNFTs

Because your sNFTs are private by default on Secret Network it means that Stashh cannot look inside your wallet to display them without your permission. To see your sNFTs on Stashh you need to create either a Permit or a Viewing Key.

If you already have a Permit or Viewing Key go to your Dashboard where you can see your Collections and the sNFTs within them that you own.


## Creating Viewing Keys or Permits

There are a few different ways to create Permits and Viewing Keys for a Collection on Stashh...

### Buying a sNFT

When you buy a sNFT Stashh will pop up a prompt for you to create a Permit or Viewing Key for the Collection that the sNFT is in.

1. Click the **Create Permit** button.
2. Your wallet will ask to create a Permit. Click **Approve**
