# Viewing sNFTs

Because your sNFTs are private by default on Secret Network it means that Stashh cannot look inside your wallet to display them without your permission. To see your sNFTs on Stashh you need to create either a Permit or a Viewing Key.

If you already have a Permit or Viewing Key go to [My Stashh](https://stashh.io/dashboard/my-stashh) where you can see your Collections and your sNFTs within them.

## Creating Viewing Keys or Permits

There are a few different ways to create Permits and Viewing Keys for a Collection on Stashh...

### Manually

!!! tip

    You can also create a permit by clicking the Key icon :duotone-key: in any Collection or sNFT asset page

If you have previously bought a sNFT and it doesn't show up in [My Stashh](https://stashh.io/dashboard/my-stashh) you probably need to recreate the Permit or Viewing Key.

1. Navigate to your Dashboard
2. Click the **Add Collection** button
3. Search for the name of the collection your sNFT belongs to and click it
4. Click the **Create Permit** button
5. Your wallet will ask to create a Permit. Click **Approve**

6. Click the **View Collection** button to view the sNFTs you own in this collection.

### During Purchase

!!! note

    When you buy a sNFT on Stashh using the One-Click Buy button it automatically creates a Permit for you. Just click the **View Collection** button after the purchase has been completed to see your sNFT.

When you buy a sNFT Stashh will pop up a prompt for you to create a Permit or Viewing Key for the Collection that the sNFT is in.

1. Click the **Create Permit** button.
2. Your wallet will ask to create a Permit. Click **Approve**
