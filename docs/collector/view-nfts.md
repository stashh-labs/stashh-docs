# Viewing sNFTs & sBadges

Because Secret Network is private by default Stashh cannot look inside your wallet to see what you own and display it without your permission. This is done by creating a Permit or a Viewing Key.

If you already have a Permit or Viewing Key go to [My Stashh](https://stashh.io/dashboard/my-stashh) where you can see your Collections and everything you own inside them.

## Creating Viewing Keys or Permits

There are several ways to create Permits and Viewing Keys for a Collection on Stashh...

### From My Stashh

If you have previously bought a sNFT and it doesn't show up in [My Stashh](https://stashh.io/dashboard/my-stashh) you probably need to recreate the Permit or Viewing Key.

1. Navigate to [My Stashh](https://stashh.io/dashboard/my-stashh)
2. Click the **Add Collection** button
3. Search for the name of the collection your sNFT belongs to and click it
4. Click the **Create Permit** button
5. Your wallet will ask to create a Permit. Click **Approve**

6. Click the **View Collection** button to view the sNFTs you own in this collection.

### From a Collection or Asset page

!!! tip

    If the Unlock Private Metadata icon :duotone-key: on the Collection or Asset page is blue it means you already have a Permit for this Collection. You can create another if you want to, but you should be able to use the current one to view what you own in [My Stashh](https://stashh.io/dashboard/my-stashh)

1. Navigate to a collection, or an Asset in a Collection where you own at least one asset.
2. Click the Unlock Private Metadata icon :duotone-key:.
3. Click the **Create Permit** button.
4. Your wallet will ask to create a Permit. Click **Approve**.

5. Navigate to [My Stashh](https://stashh.io/dashboard/my-stashh).
6. The Collection will appear in the list. Click it.

7. Stash will use the Permit to detect what you own inside the Collection and display it.
