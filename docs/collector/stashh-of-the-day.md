# Overview

Stashh of the Day (SOTD) drops a new and unique Secret Badge every 24 hours. They're totally free to claim (we even pay for gas) but the catch is that each badge is only available for 24 hours - once they’re gone, they’re gone.

## How to claim

Here is how to claim a SOTD badge.

1. Navigate to the [Stashh homepage](https://stashh.io/)
2. Look for the **Stashh of the Day Event** section towards the right of the page
3. Click on the badge that is active for that day (you’ll see a countdown timer showing how much time is left to claim) to access the badge page
4. Click the **Claim Stashh of the Day** button (claiming is completely free and does not require a transaction or paying gas)
5. If you are not connected to Stashh, we provide a few options to help you easily connect
    1. If you need to create a wallet, click **Create Quick Account** and we will create a wallet for you (make sure you save your mnemonic key somewhere safe - preferably offline!)
    2. If you already have a wallet, click **Keplr** if you are on desktop or **Fina** if you are on mobile and follow the prompts
