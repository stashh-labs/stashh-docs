## Sales Fee

Stashh charges a flat 2.75% sales fee with a 0.05 SCRT minimum.

The Sales Fee is deducted from the sellers proceeds before Royalties.

## Other Fees

Stashh does not charge any other fees.

## Network Fees

Like all blockchains Secret Network requires payment for gas when executing contracts on chain. Network fees are charged in SCRT and are paid whenever you approve a transaction. 

Fees on Secret Network are very low, so you can comfortably use Stashh with as little as 1 SCRT in your wallet.
