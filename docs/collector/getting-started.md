You're now signed into Stashh and ready to go. Check out the [Marketplace](https://stashh.io/marketplace?sort=listing_date+desc&status=buy_now%2Cauction) to see what is for sale, or browse the [Collections](https://stashh.io/collections)

## Create a sSCRT Permit

The majority of transactions on Stashh are denominated in sSCRT which is a privacy preserving version of SCRT. Because it is privacy preserving you need to grant Stashh (or anyone else) permission to view your sSCRT balance with a Viewing Key.

1. Click the Account Menu icon :fontawesome-solid-user:

    ![Account menu showing the View sSCRT Balance button](../images/account-menu-show-balance.png#pop)

2. Click **View sSCRT Balance**
3. If you have not already added sSCRT to your wallet it will pop up a message asking you to add a new token. Click **Submit**

    === "Keplr"

4. Your wallet will ask to create a Viewing Key for sSCRT. Click **Approve**
5. After a few moments your sSCRT balance will appear in the menu where *View sSCRT Balance* was. It will probably be 0 for now.
