# Buy a sNFT

Buying a sNFT on Stashh is similar to buying a sNFT on any other marketplace. The key difference is that Stashh maintains your right to privacy. Other marketplaces can look inside your wallet and see everything you own and everything you have ever done.

Stashh is different. We can't go digging around in your wallet because _nobody_ on Secret Network can without your permission.

## One-Click Buy

If Stashh detects that you have enough SCRT but not enough SNIP20 Tokens to buy a sNFT it will show the One-Click Buy button.

When you click this Stashh will convert the right amount of SCRT to the correct SNIP20 token, use it to buy the sNFT, then create a Permit for the collection in a single transaction.

## Buy a sNFT
