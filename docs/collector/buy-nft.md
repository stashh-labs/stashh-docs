# Buy a sNFT

Buying a sNFT on Stashh is similar to buying a sNFT on any other marketplace. The key difference is that Stashh maintains your right to privacy. Other marketplaces can look inside your wallet and see everything you own and everything you have ever done, but we think that is a fundamental invasion of your right to privacy. It's like allowing anyone to come into your home and dig around your stuff.

Stashh is different. We can't go digging around in your wallet because _nobody_ on Secret Network can without your permission. The trade-off for this privacy is that there are are couple of extra clicks involved when you buy a sNFT. Broadly the two things you will need to do are...

1. Swapping for SNIP20 tokens
2. Creating Permits or Viewing Keys

## One-Click Buy

If Stashh detects that you have enough SCRT but not enough SNIP20 Tokens to buy a sNFT it will show the One-Click Buy button. When you click this Stashh will convert the right amount of SCRT to the correct SNIP20 token, use it to buy the sNFT, then create a Permit for the collection in a single transaction.

1. Click the **Auto Swap Tokens and Buy Now** button

## Buy with SNIP20 Tokens

If you prefer not to use One Click Buy or the SNIP20 Token is not supported by it you can buy a sNFT with SNIP20 tokens.
