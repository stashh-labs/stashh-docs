# Buy a sNFT

Buying a sNFT on Stashh is similar to buying a sNFT on any other marketplace. The key difference is that Secret Network maintains your privacy, so where other marketplaces can just look inside your wallet and see what you own Stashh has to get your permission by way of a Permit.

There are two sales mechanisms on Stashh. The way you buy a sNFT depends on which mechanism is being used.

- [Fixed Price](./fixed-price-sale.md)
- [Auction](./auction-sales.md)

## Fixed Price

1. Click the **Buy Now** button
2. Your wallet will ask to execute several contracts in a single transaction. Click **Approve**

4. To view the sNFT click the **Find it on my Inventory** button.

### Buy with SCRT
