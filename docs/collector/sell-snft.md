## Sale Types

### Fixed Price

A Fixed Price Sale is the simplest type of sale on Stashh. When you list a sNFT for sale using Fixed Price it will be shown for sale in the Marketplace at the price you set until someone buys it or you decide to cancel the sale.

### Auction

An auction is a mechanism to find the optimal price for your sNFT. When you list an sNFT for sale as an Auction on Stashh it will be listed for a period of time during which potential buyers place bids.

There are many different kinds of Auction. Stashh currently supports English auctions where the seller sets an initial price then buyers bid incrementally until a timer runs out at which point the highest bid wins.
