# How to Swap Native Tokens for SNIP20 Tokens

Before you can buy NFTs on Stashh you need to swap some of your native tokens into their privacy-preserving SNIP20 equivelent.

## Swap SCRT to sSCRT

!!! note

    You must already have set up your wallet and connected it to Stashh

1. Click the **Menu** icon on the top bar.
1. If you see **View sSCRT Balance** you need to [create a sSCRT viewing key](/guides/add-sscrt-viewing-key) before continuing
1. Click the `Swap SCRT` button.

1. The Swapper modal will appear

1. Enter the ammount of SCRT you would like to swap to sSCRT in the **FROM SCRT** box.

    !!! warning

        You will need some SCRT for gas, so don't swap it all to sSCRT. We recommend that you keep at least 0.5 SCRT in its native form.

1. Click the **Swap** button
1. Check the transaction then click the **Approve** button
1. After a few moments a success message will appear and your balances will be updated

## Other Tokens

For other SNIP20 tokens you can use [Sienna Wrap](https://app.sienna.network/wrap) or [Secret Swap](https://app.secretswap.net/swap).

For both sites the process is very similar

1. Select the token you want to swap from and enter the amount you want to swap
2. Select the token you want to swap to
3. Create Viewing Keys for balances
4. Check that the amount you are getting is correct

    !!! warning

        If you're swapping from one SNIP20 to another on Secret Swap check the Price Impact % before hitting the go button

5. Click the **Swap**, **Wrap** or **Convert** button
6. Check and approve the transaction
