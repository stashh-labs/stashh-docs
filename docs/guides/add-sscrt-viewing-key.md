# How to Create a sSCRT Viewing Key

If you see the text **View Secret Balance** or **View Balance** where you were expecting a balance to be shown it means that your wallet does not have permission to view the balance.

To solve this you need to allow your wallet to create a Viewing Key which will give it permission to see your balance for that token.

1. Click the **View sSCRT Balance** or **View Balance** text
1. Your wallet will ask if you want to add the token to your wallet.

      ![Keplr Add Token window](\images\keplr-addtoken.png){ loading=lazy width="250" }

1. Click **Submit**
1. Review the transaction then click **Approve**

    === "Keplr"

      ![Keplr Add Token window](\images\keplr-createviewingkey.png){ loading=lazy width="250" }

1. After a few moments a success message will be shown

    !!! tip

        If the balance doesn't appear after a few moments reload the page
