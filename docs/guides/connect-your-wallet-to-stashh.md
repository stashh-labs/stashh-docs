# How to Connect your Wallet to Stashh

The first time you visit Stashh you will need to connect your wallet and authenticate by creating a permit. This only takes a couple of minutes, and you only have to do it once for each wallet you want to use with Stashh.

## Connect

Connecting your wallet allows Stashh to see the address of your currently selected wallet and trigger transaction prompts via your wallet extension.

1. When you first visit Stashh your wallet will prompt you to connect automatically.

Your wallet is now connected to Stashh, but before you can buy, sell, and create NFTs you need to Authenticate.

## Authenticate

Authenticating your wallet with Stashh generates a key that we use to verify who you are as an alternative to a username and password.
